## Open a Pull Request

This project uses a forking workflow for contributions. When in doubt, start with the
[GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for all new Pull Requests (PRs). If new to forking, refer to
[GitHub forking](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) for more information about this workflow.
If new to branching, refer to [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) for an interactive tutorial.

### Before a Pull Request

This project strives to provide a great code review experience for everyone. A great code review helps not only
the maintainers save time, but most importantly the contributors. In order to help achieve this goal,
please follow the included checklist.

  - [ ] Verify your code follows the style in the rest of the codebase, for consistency.
  - [ ] Verify your commit is granular, and represents a single logical change, for maintainability.
    - Improves the review experience for both contributor and maintainer.
    - Simplifies future operations, such as cherry-picking, log searches, diffs, etc.

Many of these steps will run automatically when you push your changes, but it is still important to verify
the results before opening a PR. This will help expedite the review process, and guarantee the best experience
for everyone.

### After a Pull Request

Code will be reviewed by one or more maintainers before being merged. In order to help maintain quality,
or in the event that automated tooling does not catch everything, maintainers may ask for additional
improvements before approving a PR. To help provide a smooth experience for everyone, please complete the self
checklist populated in the PR body. Maintainers are encouraged to wait until the checklist is complete
before reviewing a PR.

During the review process, some common requests from maintainers may include, but are not limited to:
- Handle edge cases, to improve scalability.
- Add more detail to documentation, to improve maintainability and readability.
- Include additional tests, to guarantee stability.

Do not be discouraged if a maintainer asks for changes, these are common to ensure the highest quality possible during
the life of the project. Even maintainers have to make changes to their code during the review process. No one is
perfect, but as a team we can create the best possible solutions.
